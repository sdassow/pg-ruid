# RUID - Compact and usable unique identifiers

## Reason

 - UUID representation in hex takes too much space.
 - Hex does not work as identifier depending on context.

## Solution

 - Encode to base64 for fewer characters.
 - Pad UUID before encoding and cut off again afterwards
   to make use of the padding in a way it guarantees a
   range of start and end characters.

## Example

Comparison of a single UUID vs. RUID:

    5b0ba39c-6597-11e2-9d36-001b211595d1 (36)

  vs.

    FsLo5xllxHinTYAGyEVldE (22)

This accumulates very fast and leads to a lot of terminal
space taken. For example the output of a table with just
three columns with UUIDs compared to the same output with RUIDs:

### Before

    SELECT uuid_generate_v1(), uuid_generate_v1(), uuid_generate_v1();
               uuid_generate_v1           |           uuid_generate_v1           |           uuid_generate_v1           
    --------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
     5b0ba39c-6597-11e2-9d36-001b211595d1 | 5b0ba5c2-6597-11e2-a017-001b211595d1 | 5b0ba766-6597-11e2-b5df-001b211595d1
    (1 row)

### After

    SELECT uuid_generate_v1()::ruid, uuid_generate_v1()::ruid, uuid_generate_v1()::ruid;
        uuid_generate_v1    |    uuid_generate_v1    |    uuid_generate_v1
